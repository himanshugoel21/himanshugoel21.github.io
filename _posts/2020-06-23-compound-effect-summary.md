Darren Hardy's The Compound Effect is one of the most important book that I read again and again to remind myself of the tools and techniques Darren teaches. The techniques are so simple yet so effective.

As Darren Says:
You don't make $200,000 a year spending two hours a day on the internet, or lose 30 pounds in a week.
