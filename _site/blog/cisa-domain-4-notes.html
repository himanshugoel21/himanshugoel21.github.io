<p>Main points to remember (please excuse the brevity and spell errors):</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Service provider SLA</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Most Imp â€“&gt; Transition to new or internal process post contract termination</strong></li>
      <li>Right to audit â€“ imp</li>
      <li>To check uptime reports in SLA â€“&gt; check <strong>Availability reports</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Database</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Assurance on Database Referential integrity should be provided by reviewing â€“&gt; <strong>Foreign Key Structure</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Referential entity in a RDBMS refers</strong> to the consistency between couple (linked) tables. Ref integrity is usually enforced by the combination of a primary key or candidate key (alternate key) and <strong>foreign key</strong>. For ref integrity to hold, any field in a table that is declared a foreign key should contain only values from a parent tables primary key or candidate key.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Default configuration should be changed</li>
      <li>Concerning if DBA is performing OS patches as that should be done by System Admin</li>
      <li>DBA suggests that efficiency can be increased using <strong>De-normalization</strong> â€“&gt; It results in Data Redundancy â€“&gt; <strong>Normalization is a design or optimization process for RDBMS that increases redundancy</strong>
</li>
      <li>Concurrency objective in DB â€“&gt; <strong>Ensure integrity when 2 processes attempt to update same data</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>GREATEST ASSURANCE of DATABASE INTEGRITY</strong> â€“&gt; <strong>Table link/Reference checks</strong>  â€“&gt; Performing these <strong>checks detect table link errors (such as completeness and accuracy</strong> of the contents of db) and thus provide greatest assurance of database integrity.</li>
      <li>Database audit logs should be <strong>deleted other than DBA</strong>
</li>
      <li>During maintenance of RDBMS â€“&gt; several values of <strong>foreign key in a transaction table have been corrupted</strong> â€“&gt; consequence â€“&gt; <strong>Detail of involved transactions may no longer be associated with master data, causing errors when these transactions are processed</strong>
</li>
      <li>In RDBMS with referential integrity â€“&gt; t<strong>he use of which of the following keys would prevent deletion</strong> of a ROW from customer table as long as customer number of that row is stored with live orders on the orders table â€”&gt; <strong>FOREIGN KEY</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>DENORMALIZATION â€“ WILL INCREASE RISK OF</strong>  â€”-&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥LOSS OF DATA INTEGRITY</strong>
</li>
      <li>Which DB controls would ensure that the <strong>integrity of transactions is maintained in an online transaction processing systems database</strong>  â€”&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥COMMITMENT AND ROLL BACK CONTROLS</strong>
</li>
      <li>User Spool and Database limit controls can affect the performances significantly.</li>
      <li>
<strong>Database processing suddenly comes to a halt â€“&gt; Integrity best ensured by â€“&gt;</strong> Database commits and rollbacks**</li>
      <li>
<strong>IT mgmt has decided to install RAD and remove off-site backups â€”&gt; IT auditor should re-instate for off-site backups</strong> #readquestionproperly #understandmeaning #remove2options</li>
      <li>IS auditor sees corrupted data in database â€“&gt; <strong>corrective control is</strong> â€“&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥Data restore procedures</strong>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Auditor notices patches are deployed as per vendor â€“&gt; MOST significant RISK would be that IT hasðŸ”¥ not <strong>TESTED THESE PATCHES</strong>.</li>
  <li>For any changes done in business like â€“ service provider change etc.. â€“&gt; <strong>APPLICATION OWNERS SHOULD BE INFORMED</strong>.</li>
  <li>Auditor checking change mgmnt - Most imp control that IS auditor should look for to ensure system availability â€“&gt; <strong>Test Plans and procedures exist and are closely followed</strong>
</li>
  <li>ðŸ”´ðŸ”¥Disaster Recovery Plan - DRP (ðŸ’¥Addresses Tech aspect of BCPðŸ’¥)
    <ul>
      <li>Auditor reviewing <strong>DR PLAN</strong> â€“&gt; Plan should <strong>PRIMARILY COVERS</strong> â€“&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ANALYSIS and PRIORITIZATION OF BUSINESS FUNCTIONS</strong>
</li>
      <li>Downtime cost increases with time.</li>
      <li>ðŸ”¥<strong>Most Imp element</strong> to effectively execute a DRP â€“&gt; <strong>Offsite storage of backup data</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>Business Impact Analysis</strong> should be used in DRP for it to be successful</li>
      <li>ðŸ”¥<strong>NO TEST DONE IS CRITICAL</strong> â€“ DRP â€“&gt; <strong>auditor observed remote offices have very limited local IT resources</strong> â€“&gt; <strong>MOST Critical</strong> â€“&gt; is that <strong>ðŸ”´no test is done to ensure that local resources</strong> could maintain security and service standards when recovering from a disaster or incident.</li>
      <li>
<strong>Periodically Test - DRP â€“ for continued compatibility</strong> of the contingency facilities</li>
      <li>Org recovery from disaster in which not all critical data was retained â€“ &gt; <strong>Issue with RPO</strong>
</li>
      <li>Org DR plan - Auditor should <strong>Primarily</strong> verify that â€“ <strong>regularly reviewed and updated</strong>
</li>
      <li>Auditor reviewing DR of hot site used by financial institution â€“&gt; <strong>Greatest Concern</strong> in this is â€“&gt; <strong>Disk space Utilization data are not kept current</strong> â€“&gt; without data of disks it can lead to a big disaster</li>
      <li>
<strong>BEST Evidence of an org DR capabilities</strong> â€”&gt; <strong>RESULTS OF TESTS</strong>
</li>
      <li>ðŸ”¥<strong>MOST IMP</strong> to review when conducting â€“ DR AUDIT â€“&gt; <strong>DATA BACKUPS ARE Performed Timely and Stored Offsite</strong>
</li>
      <li>Data Mirroring Strategy â€“&gt; When Data doesnâ€™t need be lost at all â€“&gt; <strong>Hence RPO is low</strong> â€”&gt; <strong>Low Data Loss â€“&gt; Low RPO</strong>
</li>
      <li>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥When <strong>reviewing DRP</strong> â€“&gt; Auditor will be <strong>MOST CONCERNED</strong> with the lack of ðŸ”´ðŸ”´<strong>PROCESS OWNER INVOLVEMENT</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>IF Recovery TIME OBJECTIVE INCREASES â€“&gt; ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥The Disaster Tolerance Increases</strong> â€“&gt; it means if 5 days are required than company can tolerate upto 5 days of without business.</li>
      <li>DRP of a big org is changed and not tested â€“&gt; <strong>Impact is catastrophic service disruption</strong>
</li>
      <li>When developing <strong>DRP, the criteria for determining the acceptable downtime</strong> should be â€“&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥MAXIMUM TOLERABLE OUTAGE</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>BACKUP TECHNIQUES to use</strong> â€“&gt; MOST appropriate when an org requires <strong>ðŸ”´ðŸ”´EXTREMELY GRANULAR</strong> data restore points â€“&gt; <strong>CONTINUOUS DATA BACKUP</strong> â€“&gt; <strong>SHORT /LOW RPO â€“&gt; Continuous backup â€“ best option</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>LOWER RECOVERY TIME OBJECTIVE</strong>  â€”&gt; <strong>HIGHER COSTS</strong> â€“ <strong>ðŸ’¥HOT SITE</strong>
</li>
      <li><strong>LOWER RPO â€“&gt; Granular backup â€“&gt; Continuous backup</strong></li>
      <li>During DR test, auditor notes that <strong>server is slow â€“</strong>&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥Best possible scenario is to check the configuration of the server</strong> (if some unauth actions done on server, then check logs)</li>
      <li>
<strong>GREATEST CONCERN</strong> when reviewing IT DR <strong>TEST</strong> â€”&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥During test, some of the backup systems were DEFECTIVE and NOT WORKING â€“ causing the test to FAIL</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>Frequent updating of which</strong> of the following is key to the continued <strong>effectiveness of a DR plan</strong> â€”&gt; <strong>ðŸ”´ðŸ’¥Contact information of key personnel</strong>
</li>
      <li><strong>To address an org DR requirements, backup intervals should not exceed â€”&gt; ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥RPO</strong></li>
      <li>
<strong>MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DETERMINE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DR PLAN</strong> â€”â€”&gt; <strong>Efficient</strong> â€“&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥Preparedness test</strong>
</li>
      <li>In a contract with a hot, warm, or cold site, contractual provisions should PRIMARILY cover â€“&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥Number of subscribers permitted to use a site at one time</strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥</li>
      <li>
<strong>MOST APPROPRIATE recovery strategy for a sensitive system with a high recovery time objective (RTO)</strong>  â€”-&gt; <strong>High RTO â€“High disaster tolerance</strong> â€“&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥Cold Site.</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>For structured DR â€“ MOST imp is that business continuity and disaster recover plan</strong>  â€” &gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥TESTED REGULARLY</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>BEST METHOD TO ENSURE</strong> â€” critical IT system failures doesnâ€™t recur â€“Â» <strong>PERFORM ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS</strong>.</li>
      <li>
<strong>Auditor reviewing most recent disaster recovery plan of an org</strong> â€“&gt; WHOSE APPROVAL IS IMP when determining availability of system resources required for the PLAN â€”â€”â€“Â Â»&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥IT MANAGEMENT</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>AFTER TABLE TOP</strong> â€”&gt; <strong>NEXT STEP WOULD BE to be perform ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥FUNCTIONAL TESTS</strong> â€“ which includes mobilization of the staff to exercise admin and org functions.</li>
      <li><strong>TESTS FOR CO-ORDINATION in which relevant members participate â€“&gt; Paper based test</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Prepared-ness test is performed by EACH local office to test the adequacy of the preparedness of local operations.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Business Continuity PLAN</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Continuity Test Plan</strong> that <strong>simulates crash and uses actual resources</strong> to cost effectively obtain evidence â€”â€“&gt; ðŸ”¥<strong>PREPAREDNESS TEST</strong>
</li>
      <li>ðŸ”´<strong>Designing BCP for airlines</strong> â€“&gt; <strong>MOST APPROPRIATE</strong> method of data transfer/backup at an offsite location would be â€“&gt; ðŸ”¥<strong>SHADOW FILE PROCESSING</strong> â€“&gt; <strong>Exact duplicates of the files are maintained</strong> at the same site or at a remote site â€“&gt; Two files are processed concurrently â€“&gt; good for airlines. (<strong>hot sites takes time - like few hours</strong>)</li>
      <li>
<strong>Most Imp in developing - BCP</strong> â€”â€”â€“Â»Â»&gt; ðŸ”¥<strong>Process Owner</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>MAJOR CONCERN</strong>  for IS auditor â€“&gt; Test results are not documented â€“ <strong>Effectiveness of BCP can be best determined through tests</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE</strong> of BCP test is â€“&gt; <strong>Identify limitations of BCP</strong>
</li>
      <li>IS auditor <strong>interviews key stakeholders in an org to determine whether they understand their roles and resp</strong> â€”&gt; IS auditor is attempting to <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥evaluate the clarity and simplicity of the business continuity plans</strong>.</li>
      <li>During BCP â€“ <strong>IS auditor noticed that the point at which</strong> Situation is declared to be a crisis has not been identified <strong>â€”-&gt;</strong> MAJOR RISK associated with this is â€”&gt; ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥EXECUTION OF THE DR PLAN COULD BE IMPACTED**</li>
      <li>
<strong>WHICH BEST helps define disaster recovery strategies</strong> â€“&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥MAX TOLERABLE Downtime and data loss</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>After disaster declaration</strong>  â€“&gt; Media creation date at a warm recovery site is based on <strong>ðŸ’¥ðŸ”¥RPO</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>Activation of an enterprise BCP should be based on pre-determined criteria</strong> â€”&gt; that address the <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”´DURATION OF THE OUTAGE</strong>.</li>
      <li>
<strong>MOST effective business continuity plan</strong> â€“&gt; <strong>Planning involves all user departments</strong>
</li>
      <li><strong>Important to note that â€“ Responsibility of declaring a disaster is very imp</strong></li>
      <li>
<strong>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE of BCP PROCESS</strong> â€”&gt; is to <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥focus on managing and mitigating risk during recovery</strong> of operations due to an event that affected operations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>For acceptable time period for the resumption of critical business processes</strong> â€“&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥Both downtime costs and recovery costs need to be evaluated</strong>
</li>
  <li>ðŸ”´Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable for data communication over copper based has advantage of â€“&gt; <strong>reducing crosstalk</strong>
</li>
  <li>Method of routing traffic through <strong>split cable or duplicate cable</strong> is <strong>Diverse Cable</strong> (SC DC)</li>
  <li>
<strong>To verify correct version of a data file used for prod</strong> â€“&gt; Auditor should review <strong>SYSTEM LOGS</strong>
</li>
  <li>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥Best audit procedures to determine if <strong>unauth changes have been made to prod code</strong> â€“&gt; is to <strong>ðŸ”¥Examine object code to find instances of changes and trace them back to change control records</strong>
</li>
  <li>ðŸ”´ðŸ”¥<strong>IS auditor should review?</strong> to ensure servers are optimally configured to support processing requirements â€“  <strong>SERVER UTILIZATION REPORTS</strong>
</li>
  <li>ðŸ”¥<strong>Purpose of Code Signing</strong> is â€”â€“&gt; <strong>ðŸ”´Software has not been subsequently modified.</strong>
</li>
  <li>ðŸ”¥When reviewing process for continuous monitoring of the capacity and performance of IT resources an IS auditor <strong>PRIMARILY</strong> ensure that process is focused on â€“&gt; <strong>Accurate feedback on IT resource capacity</strong>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Business impact analysis (BIA)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Best source of information for determining the criticality of application systems â€“&gt; <strong>Business Process Owners</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>PRIMARY PURPOSE of business impact analysis</strong> â€”-&gt; <strong>Define recovery strategy</strong>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ðŸ”¥Which of the following reports should an <strong>IS auditor use to check compliance with a service level agreementâ€™s</strong> requirement for uptime â€“&gt; <strong>Availability reports</strong>
</li>
  <li>ðŸ”¥IS auditor use to determine if unauthorized modifications were made to production programs â€“&gt; <strong>Compliance Testing</strong>
</li>
  <li>ðŸ”´<strong>MOST helpful</strong> when evaluating the effectiveness and adequacy of a preventive computer maintenance program â€“&gt; <strong>System downtime log provides evidence regarding the effectiveness and adequacy of computer preventive maintenance program</strong>
</li>
  <li>ðŸ”¥<strong>Online pooling tool to monitor</strong> and record application outages is the best option for an org to monitor the software as a service application availability.</li>
  <li>ðŸ”´<strong>Help Desk Function</strong> â€“&gt; is a service oriented unit â€“&gt; <strong>End users must be advised before an incident can be regarded as closed</strong>
</li>
  <li>POS â€“&gt; <strong>centralized communication processor for connecting to the banking</strong> network. Best DR plan â€“&gt; <strong>Alternative standby processor at another network node</strong> would be the best solution. The unavailability of the central communications processor would disrupt.</li>
  <li>Evaluating programmed controls over password management, which of the following is the IS auditor <strong>MOST</strong> likely to rely on â€“&gt; <strong>**Validity check would be the most useful for the verification of passwords</strong> because it would verify that the <strong>required format</strong> has been used - for example not using dictionary word.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Reciprocal Agreement</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>GREATEST RISK</strong> of reciprocal in different companies â€“ Developments may result in h/w and s/w incompatibility.</li>
      <li>
<strong>GREATEST RISK</strong> in reciprocal of same business units â€“&gt; Affected by <strong>same disaster risk â€“ same incident.</strong>
</li>
      <li>
<strong>Reciprocal MITIGATION OF RISKS</strong> â€“&gt; Ensure that partnering organizations are separated geographically</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Most effective in ensuring that production code and object code are in sync</strong> â€“&gt;  <strong>Date and timestamp reviews of source and object code</strong>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Most Effective</strong> to detect malicious activity in production program â€“&gt; <strong>Review of system log files</strong>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Recovery procedures for an Information processing facility</strong> â€“  <strong>BEST</strong> BASED ON â€“&gt; <strong>Recovery Time Objective</strong>
</li>
  <li>Maximum Tolerable Outage â€“&gt; amount of time allowed for the recovery of a business function or resource after a disaster occurs: <strong>represents a time by which the service must be restored</strong>
</li>
  <li>ðŸ”µCapacity Management
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Primary benefit</strong> of IT Manager monitoring technical capacity â€“ensure that SLA req are met. Capacity Management has several objectives â€“&gt; <strong>MAIN IS SLA REQ</strong>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Change Control Process
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Most efficient way to test effectiveness of change management process</strong> â€”&gt; <strong>Perform end to end walkthrough of the process</strong>
</li>
      <li>IS auditor noted a <strong>system crash caused by security patch</strong> â€“&gt; To provide assurance this wont happen again, auditor should â€“&gt; <strong>change management process is adequate</strong>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>For proper SOD â€“&gt; developer should have access to development only â€“ any code change should be again done as part of the development cycle</strong></li>
  <li>Reporting and responsibility lines cannot always be established when auditing automated systems because â€”&gt;  <strong>ownership is difficult to establish where resources are shared</strong>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>Library control S/w</strong> â€”&gt;  <strong>Main objective</strong> of Library control s/w is <strong>changes have been authorized</strong>
</li>
  <li>Auditor examining the security config of an OS should review â€“&gt; <strong>parameter settings</strong>
</li>
  <li><strong>In Open Source s/w â€“&gt; Identify and test suitable patches before applying them</strong></li>
  <li>
<strong>Main Criterion for determining the severity level of a service disruption incident is</strong> â€”â€”Â»&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥DOWNTIME</strong>
</li>
  <li>Performing preventive maintenance on electrical systems can result in <strong>unexpected downtime</strong> during office hours.</li>
  <li>During recent app development â€“&gt; auditor noted that sla was miss due to <strong>incorrect priorities</strong> â€“&gt; <strong>Support model was not properly developed and implemented</strong>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>GREATEST RISK WHEN SERVER STORAGE IS NOT MANAGED PROPERLY</strong> â€”&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥Server recovery work may not meet the recovery time objective</strong>
</li>
  <li><strong>FIRST STEP in the execution of a problem management mechanism should be â€”-&gt;ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Exception Reporting</strong></li>
  <li>
<strong>RAID LEVEL</strong>  â€” <strong>PRIMARY PURPOSE</strong> â€”-&gt; ðŸ”¥Ensure Availability of data</li>
  <li>
<strong>Important consideration in providing backup for online systems â€“&gt; Ensuring periodic dumps of transaction logs</strong>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Supervisory approval and review of critical changes</strong> by the accountable managers in the enterprises are required to avoid and detect any unauth change.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Incident response team</strong> â€“&gt; should handle this <strong>first after a major incident</strong> in a facility â€“&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥Containment at the facility</strong>
</li>
  <li>
<strong>SERVICE DELIVERY OBJECTIVE â€“ SDO</strong> â€“&gt; is the <strong>ðŸ”¥level of service to be reached during the alternate process mode</strong> until the normal situation is restored. This is directly related to the business needs.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Configuration mgmt database (CMDB) â€“ is used to track configuration items</strong> - CI. <strong>OUT OF DATE CMDB in a large MNC could result in incorrect approvals</strong>
</li>
  <li><strong>Incremental backup â€“&gt; When first time full backup thereafter daily backup only â€“&gt; MOST APPROPRIATE WHEN THERE IS LIMITED MEDIA CAPACITY</strong></li>
  <li>What MITIGATES the best â€“ risk of backup media containing irreplaceable information being lost or stolen in transit â€”&gt; <strong>DUPLICATE COPY</strong>
</li>
  <li><strong>Emergency changes can be approved later on â€“ after the activity is finished</strong></li>
  <li>MOST efficient strategy to backup large quantity mission critical data that needs to be supported 24hours a day â€“&gt; <strong>implementing a fault tolerant disk to disk backup solution</strong>
</li>
  <li>For <strong>PATCHES</strong> ensure <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥APP OWNER and ðŸ”´ðŸ”´DATA OWNER ARE</strong> aware of the same and <strong>their approvals</strong> are taken.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Emergency changes are done when</strong> â€”&gt; there is a high probability of significant impact on operations.</li>
  <li>For <strong>Emergency changes, best accountability for the support personnel is to create a specific individual support ID â€“ when required</strong> â€“ later on to be deleted.</li>
  <li><strong>Automated tool can immediately provide a report which patches are running and applied</strong></li>
  <li>
<strong>BEST ensures accountability when updating data directly in a production database</strong> â€”&gt; <strong>ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥Review of Audit Logs</strong>
</li>
  <li><strong>Performance criteria for the authentication servers would be helpful to evaluate thresholds of the system performance</strong></li>
  <li><strong>MOST effective control for enforcing ACCOUNTABILITY â€”&gt; Implement a log management process</strong></li>
